Dependency inversion is the principle of expressing dependencies between high-level and low-level modules or resources through abstractions.
Dependency inversion returns an abstraction of the low-level resource metadata to the resource that depends on it.
Attribute interpolation -> directly add dependency as parameter
Module output -> Get module information from output
Infrastructure state -> Get dependency module from infrastructure api. You can use teraform data for this.
